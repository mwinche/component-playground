Web Component Playground
========================

Web Components are awesome and amazing. This repo explores some basic usage of the core portions of the web component standard.

1. [The `template` tag](https://github.com/mwinche/component-playground/tree/step1)
2. [Custom Elements](https://github.com/mwinche/component-playground/tree/step2)
3. [Shadow DOM](https://github.com/mwinche/component-playground/tree/step3)
4. [HTML Imports](https://github.com/mwinche/component-playground/tree/step4)

This README will explain each of these portions of the standard and with each tag in the repo.

You can serve this up using any HTTP server, but your browser will have to support Web Components for it to work (Chrome Beta or Canary at time of writing).
